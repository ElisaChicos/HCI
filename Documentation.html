        <h2><span>1. </span>What does the application?</h2>
        <p>   
        I created a graphical interface for an application that helps people who want to donate blood or people who need blood.

        <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            4.5 million Americans will a need blood transfusion each year. 43,000 pints: amount of donated blood used each day in the U.S. and Canada. Someone needs blood every two seconds. Only 37 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood - less than 10 percent do annually.
            <p>
            Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood. It is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. Whether a patient receives whole blood, red cells, platelets or plasma, this lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation.
        </p>
            <p>
            I set out to create a mobile app to help people who are looking for a donation center and people who need blood.
